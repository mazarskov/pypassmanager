# Pyhton Password Manager
A password manager that encrypts your password and stores the encrypted version on your machine.

This simple application was made because I had lots of passwords for lots of different websites and accounts but didn't store them anywhere. 
Not wanting to store my passwords in plaintext I decided to create this simple application.

## What can this application do?
* **Encrypt using an AES key**
* **Decrypt using an AES key**
* **Generate a random AES key**
* **Store the encrypted text on your machine**
* Encrypt using hash (W.I.P)
* Store a website name and username alongside the password (W.I.P)
